# Express Note Taker

## Description

This is a simple not taking application that saves your notes in a jason file and display on the page when you select the note from the list.

## How to Use

This is a simple application on the homepage you will find a button that says Get Started, click to go to the notes page. Once on the page you will see on the left side there is a big field for you to put a Title to your note and then the spot for the text within the note.

When you start to type in your note and give it a title a button in the top left hand corner will pop up that is in the shape of a floppy disk that you hit to save the note to the database.

The pencil right next to the save button is a button to create a new note.

Once you have the notes saved you can click on your note on the right side of the page where the titles are, when you select it it brings up note you previously saved.

You can delete your saved notes by pressing the red trash can next to the note.

## Challenges with building this page

The main problem I had with this page was a simple one that I should have been paying more attention to. Some files were already given to us so when I was working on the files I was working on the ones in the original file instead of bringing them to a new file to make my own repository. So my work would be saved there and then I would open the pages from my file and nothing would be changing. Then I figured it out but somehow then started working on the files in the file that was given instead of the ones in my repository. Got that figured out and had some issues with the structure of the folder for linking scripts. 

With Express the biggest thing that had me going in circles was me being confused on the urls used because it isn't the url you would use when you are looking at the actualy page it is just the url that you are grabbing the information from.
